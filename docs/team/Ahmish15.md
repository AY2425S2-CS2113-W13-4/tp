## Enhancements implemented
Split the AddLogsCommand into 5 different classes to make it more modular and easier to read. Added the SearchCommand and BMICommand classes to allow users to search for their logs and calculate their BMI respectively. I also played a key role in implementing testing for the BMI, search and List commands.

## Contributions to the UG

## Contributions to the DG

BMI Sequence Diagram and Storage Class Diagram. I also talked about the BMI command and Storage class in the DG.
