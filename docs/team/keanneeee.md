## Enhancements implemented

I took charge of the implementations of the Goal and Water functions. I was focused on designing the features such
that it would be user-friendly all the while not compromising on the user's experience as well as giving them the full 
experience that our app was meant to deliver.

I also was involved in a few major revamps that our team decided for the projects, such as the increase in teh OOP-ness
of the project by splitting the parser and command execution functions. Our project compartmentalizes functionality in
a sense that we have a function which handles its own logic (command classes), while the input is getting parsed by a 
separate, exclusive function. This drastically improved readability of our code and made our whole project much easier 
to understand.
