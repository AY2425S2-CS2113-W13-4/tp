goals. It supports logging of meals, workouts, water intake, cardio sessions, and personal bests, while also offering
intelligent features such as progress status and workout recommendations.

## Enhancements implemented

I took charge of the implementations of the Goal and Water functions. I was focused on designing the features such
that it would be user-friendly all the while not compromising on the user's experience as well as giving them the full 
experience that our app was meant to deliver.

I also was involved in a few major revamps that our team decided for the projects, such as the increase in teh OOP-ness
of the project by splitting the parser and command execution functions. Our project compartmentalizes functionality in
a sense that we have a function which handles its own logic (command classes), while the input is getting parsed by a 
separate, exclusive function. This drastically improved readability of our code and made our whole project much easier 
to understand.

## Contributions to the UG

I added the Goal and Water sections of the UG.

## Contributions to the DG

I added the Goals Section as well as the Architecture Diagram.

## Contributions to team-based tasks

I ensured that there was in depth testing being done for all our functions. Specifically:
- Wrote comprehensive tests for add goals and water.
- Helped to review and refactor existing test cases to align with our new parser-logic separation

In terms of the entire project:
- I reviewed parts of our teams code and spotted a few bugs which I proceeded to fix
- Reviewed and linked PRs to branch such that the entire process ran smoothly
