## Design & implementation
### Overall Architecture

HealthBud is structured following a Command-based architecture.
Key components:
1. Main class – Starts the application.
2. Parser – Interprets user input and returns the appropriate Command object.
3. Command classes – Each user command (e.g., AddLogCommand, BMICommand, RecommendCommand) is encapsulated in its own class.
4. LogList – Maintains lists for each log type (Meal, Workout, Water, etc.).
5. Storage – Handles saving and loading of logs from a local text file.
6. Ui – Responsible for displaying messages to the user.

### Features
{@everyone i think this is where u add the week 10 DG stuff??? tbh i think this is chattable - kin}
#### Recommend

1. Feature overview
   The RecommendCommand feature allows users to receive workout recommendations tailored to a specific muscle group. The
   command takes the form recommend <muscle_group> and responds with a set of 3 recommended exercises. This feature is
   intended for fitness enthusiasts who may need guidance or variety in their training routines.

2. Implementation details
   The RecommendCommand class extends the base Command class and overrides the execute method. The command supports inputs
   like recommend biceps, recommend legs, and so on. The logic of selecting which recommendation to print is
   encapsulated in a helper method getRecommendation(String input) which parses the input and returns a corresponding
   string. The execute method is kept clean and only responsible for printing this result to the console. This
   separation also makes the logic more testable, as the string-producing logic in getRecommendation() can be unit
   tested independently without checking the output stream.

3. Why this design
- Separation of concerns: By moving the recommendation content generation to a separate method, we improve readability
  and testability.
- Scalability: Adding new muscle groups or modifying messages is centralized in getRecommendation(), making it easier to
  extend.
- Robustness: Proper input validation and informative error messages ensure a good user experience.

4. Alternatives considered
- Using Enums for muscle groups: Initially considered using an enum with mappings to lists of exercises. While this
  improves type-safety, it adds overhead and less flexibility for user input variations.
- Reading recommendations from a file: Considered storing recommendations in a file, but added unnecessary I/O for a
  static set of data.

5. Sequence Diagrams
- {to be updated using plantUML}

6. Future Improvements
- Store recommendations in a config file or JSON for easier modification.

1. Feature overview:
   FindCommand enables users to search for log entries that contain a specific keyword within a particular category (e.g., meal, workout, water).
   Users invoke the command with the format: `find` <log_type> <keyword>.
   Upon execution, the command traverses the corresponding log list and prints out any log entries that contain the specified keyword.
   This feature is particularly useful for quickly retrieving relevant logs based on user-provided search terms.

2. Implementation details:
   Input Parsing & Validation:
   The command begins by trimming and splitting the input string into parts. It expects at least three tokens (the command word, the log type, and the keyword).
   Type-Based Delegation:
   A switch-case statement directs the search to the appropriate `LogList` (e.g., mealLogs, workoutLogs, waterLogs) based on the provided log type.
   Delegated Search Logic:
   The actual keyword search is handled by the `findLog` method within each `LogList`. This method iterates over the logs and prints matching entries using the UI helper methods.
   Error Handling:
   If the input is improperly formatted or the log type is invalid, a custom `InvalidFindException` is thrown, ensuring that the user receives clear feedback on what went wrong.

3. Why this design:
   Separation of Concerns:
   By delegating the keyword search logic to the findLog method within the LogList, the FindCommand class remains focused solely on input parsing and routing. This separation improves readability and testability.
   Modularity and Maintainability:
   The design allows for easy updates. For example, if new log types are added or the search logic needs enhancement, changes are isolated to the relevant LogList or the switch-case structure in FindCommand.
   Robustness:
   Input validation and exception handling ensure that the command fails gracefully, providing clear error messages when users supply invalid inputs.

4. Alternatives considered:
   Centralized Search in the Parser:
   An alternative was to perform the search directly within the Parser class. However, this approach would have mixed command routing with business logic, reducing modularity and making unit testing more difficult.
   Advanced Search Techniques:
   Using more sophisticated filtering techniques (e.g., regular expressions or fuzzy matching) was considered. Ultimately, a simple keyword search was chosen to keep the implementation straightforward while meeting current requirements.

5. Sequence Diagrams:


6. Future Improvements:
   Enhanced Search Capabilities:
   Incorporate multi-keyword search, case-insensitive matching, or fuzzy search to better capture user intent.
   UI Feedback Enhancements:
   Improve user feedback by highlighting the keyword in the matching results or providing suggestions when no matches are found.
   Support for Additional Log Types:
   As the application evolves, extend the command to support searching in other log categories (e.g., cardio or pb).
   Configuration Options:
   Allow users to customize search parameters or filter results based on date ranges or other log attributes.

## BMICommand
### 1. Feature overview:
The **BMICommand** feature allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and receive a classification (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese). It’s useful for users who want a quick health metric based on their height and weight inputs.
### 2. Implementation details:
Inherits from InputOnlyCommand (which in turn extends the base Command class) to handle input parsing.

Stores weight and height as immutable (final) fields.
### 3. Why this design:
Single Responsibility:
The BMI calculation is isolated in its own command, keeping the logic clean and focused.

Readability & Testability:
The concise code structure makes it easy to unit test and maintain.

Extensibility:
Future changes (e.g., additional BMI categories or metrics) can be made in this class without impacting other parts of the system.
###  4. Alternatives considered:
online Calculation in the Parser

Implementing BMI logic directly in the parser would mix concerns and lead to a more complex parser design.

Using an External Library

Given the simplicity of the BMI formula, an external library would add unnecessary complexity.

6. Future Improvements

## SearchCommand
### 1. Feature overview:
The SearchCommand feature allows users to search through their logs by either a specific date or a keyword. This enables users to quickly filter and locate log entries—for example, finding all logs on a particular day or identifying entries that mention a specific term.
### 2. Implementation details:
#### Inheritance:
Inherits from OneLogCommand (which in turn extends the base Command class) to operate on a single LogList.
#### Immutable Fields:
Stores the search parameters (either date or keyword) as immutable (final) fields.
#### Dual Search Logic:
implements two search approaches:
1. **Keyword Search**: Searches through the log entries for a specific keyword.
2. **Date Search**: Filters log entries based on a specific date.
### 3. Why this design:
Single Responsibility:
The search functionality is isolated within its own command, ensuring the logic is clean, focused, and easy to manage.

Readability & Testability:
The clear separation between date-based and keyword-based searches simplifies both understanding and unit testing.

Extensibility:
Future enhancements—such as combining filters or adding new search criteria—can be integrated with minimal changes to the existing structure.
Readability & Testability:
The concise code structure makes it easy to unit test and maintain.

Extensibility:
Future changes (e.g., additional BMI categories or metrics) can be made in this class without impacting other parts of the system.
###  4. Alternatives considered:
Extending AllLogsCommand:
One alternative was to have the search functionality span multiple log types simultaneously by extending AllLogsCommand. However, this approach was rejected because it would complicate the search logic and user interface. Users typically search within a single log category, so isolating the search to one log list made the command simpler and clearer.

Parser-Only Filtering:
Another alternative was to handle filtering entirely within the parser, returning a filtered list rather than a command that executes a search. This was not chosen because encapsulating the search behavior in a dedicated command class improves separation of concerns and aligns with the command-based architecture used throughout the project.

5. Sequence Diagrams 
### Future Improvements
Combined Search Criteria:
Future enhancements could allow users to combine search parameters (e.g., filtering by both date and keyword simultaneously) to refine their search results further.

Advanced Filtering Options:
Implementing range-based date searches, fuzzy matching for keywords, or even categorizing results by relevance could improve user experience.

Result Ranking & Pagination:
For logs with many entries, adding functionality to rank results by relevance or paginate long lists could enhance usability.

Improved Logging & Metrics:
Incorporating logging of search queries and performance metrics could help monitor usage patterns and optimize search efficiency in future releases.

1. Feature overview

The AddWorkoutCommand allows users to track their strength training exercise in the HealthBud application.
This feature captures five key pieces of information for each workout session:
The name of the exercise, the weight done in Kg, the number of repetitions performed, the number of sets completed, and the date of the workout.
The system stores these records in a dedicated workout log list that users can view, modify, or analyze over time.

Users interact with this feature through a structured command format:
`add workout` [Workout_name] /w [weight in Kg] /r [number of reps] /s [number of sets] /d [date]

2. Implementation details

When users enter an "add workout" command, the system follows a defined sequence of operations to ensure proper recording of exercise data.
The process begins with the GeneralParser, which identifies the command type and directs workout entries to the specialized AddWorkoutParser.
This dedicated parser performs comprehensive validation of three required parameters:
the weight done in kg (/w) repetition count (/r), set count (/s), and workout date (/d).
Each parameter undergoes strict format checking - repetitions and sets must be positive integers, while the date must follow a valid, recognizable format.
For the workout name, the system extracts all text preceding the first parameter marker while ensuring it contains valid characters
During command execution, the system instantiates a new WorkOUT object with the verified parameters.
This immutable data object is then added to the application's centralized workout log.
All exceptions, including invalid numeric values or date formats, are caught and presented to users as actionable error messages.
3. Why this design

The current implementation follows several key design principles to ensure robustness and maintainability.
The command pattern was deliberately chosen to create a clear separation between parsing user input and executing commands.
This architectural decision makes the system more modular, allowing individual workout commands to be modified or extended without affecting other components.

Parameter processing follows a flexible yet strict validation approach.
By using dedicated markers (/w, /r, /s, /d), the system accommodates natural variations in command entry while maintaining rigorous data quality standards.
This design choice significantly improves user experience by accepting parameters in any order, rather than enforcing a rigid sequence.

The WorkOUT class implements an immutable design pattern for important reliability benefits.
Once created, workout records cannot be accidentally modified, which prevents data corruption and simplifies debugging.
This immutability also enables thread-safe operations, future-proofing the application for potential multi-threaded enhancements.

The parsing logic incorporates multiple validation layers for maximum data integrity.
Each parameter undergoes type checking, format verification, and range validation before being accepted.
This thorough validation occurs before any changes to application state, following the fail-fast principle to prevent partial or invalid updates.
4. Alternatives considered

We initially considered using positional arguments rather than parameter markers,
where users would enter values in a fixed order (e.g., "add workout [name] [weight] [reps] [sets] [date]").
This approach was ultimately rejected because it proved less intuitive for users and more prone to input errors.
The current marker-based system (/w, /r, /s, /d) provides clearer visual separation of parameters and allows for more flexible command entry.

We also explored using a single unified Log class with type differentiation,
rather than dedicated classes for each log type.
This unified approach was abandoned because it would have required extensive runtime type checking and reduced type safety.
The current specialized class structure provides better compile-time checks and more intuitive code organization.

5. Sequence Diagrams
6. Future Improvements

The weight tracking functionality will be enhanced to support more advanced strength training scenarios.
This will include the ability to record varying weights within a single workout session, such as pyramid sets or drop sets, through an expanded command syntax.

1. Feature Overview

The Goals feature allows users to set and view personalized health goals within the chatbot. These include:
Daily Water Intake Goal (/w), Daily Calorie Intake Goal (/cal), Weight Goal (/kg)

2. Implementation Details

The goal command is implemented as part of a switch statement in the main command handling logic. Here's how it works:
Upon entering the goal command using the command "add goal", the user is greeted and shown their current goals from the
singleton Goals class instance. The chatbot enters a loop where it listens for specific goal-editing commands:
/w [value] updates the daily water goal, /cal [value] updates the daily calorie goal, /kg [value] updates the target
weight progress prompts the user to select a day to view progress data from waterLogs, mealLogs, and weight history.
The user inputs are parsed with Scanner, and exceptions such as InvalidDateException and InvalidGoalException
are handled gracefully.

3. Why This Design
   Simplicity: Using a command-line loop with conditionals provides clear control flow and is easy to debug.
   Singleton Pattern: Goals.getInstance() ensures consistent access and modification of user goals.
   User-Friendly Prompts: Each interaction provides guidance on valid inputs and current status.
   Separation of Concerns: Goal logic is kept distinct from log retrieval (waterLogs, mealLogs), enabling modular testing.

4. Alternatives Considered
   Command Pattern: We considered implementing a command design pattern to encapsulate each action
   (e.g., update water goal), but deemed it too complex for the scope.
   GUI-based input: Given the chatbot nature and CLI interaction, we opted not to build a graphical interface.
   Database-backed goal storage: For now, data is likely held in-memory for simplicity; persistent storage could
   be added later.

5. Sequence Diagrams

6. Future Improvements
   Input validation: Add regex or parsing to ensure valid numeric inputs.
   Persistent Storage: Save goals and logs to a file or database for state retention across sessions.
   Multi-user support: Refactor to support multiple user profiles.
   Goal recommendations: Suggest goals based on user history or health data.
   GUI/Web Interface: Build a frontend to visualize progress and make goal-setting more intuitive.
